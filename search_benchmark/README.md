# Qdrant search speed benchmark


## Data

Based on https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks#data-sets

GloVe Angular 100: http://ann-benchmarks.com/glove-100-angular.hdf5


## Usage


Download data

```bash
bash get_data.sh
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Qdrant instance

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Upload search data

```bash
python -m benchmark.upload_data
```

Uploaded data available for search immediately, but building of HNSW index may take quite some time. 

Run search benchmark

```bash
python -m benchmark.search
```
